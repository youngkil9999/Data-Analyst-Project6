Summary :
Acura Dataset. Analyzed how the Acura models changed time by time since 2010.
Could figure out how the Acura model sales changed and trend going on with Acura brand.
Used multiple line chart and stacked bar chart type.


Design : 

Chart type : Multiple line chart, Stacked bar chart.

Visualization explanation.

I chose the Acura data set to figure out how Acura model sales changes time to time in US and CA.
Possibly figure out the characteristic of US and CA interest.

I used two chart types, multiple lines and Stacked bar. 
I think multiple line chart easy to understand how the model sales changed every month and could see easily the trend of Acura model sales.
In stacked bar chart, the total sales could be noticed easily every month.

First thing is first. when I just look at the line chart, MDX and RDX are popular in both countries. Even though the sales amount is different, the model people preferred to buy is not that different in both country and the other model sales amounts are getting decreased and they stopped production I think from 2015.

Interesting thing is that it is easily noticeable that there is peak period in US sales trend. Every end of year had a high peak point in US data. 
Otherwise, Canada chart shows high peak period in the beginning of each year. It looks like around March~April. It is really interesting they have different bargain date. 
Also, Most of America sales amounts focused on the 2nd half of each year but they are more focused on the beginning of each year in Canada.

How about total sales amount in each country.
It seems like US sales average is ten times more than the CA sales average. I have no idea Canada auto market but I could estimate two things Acura model is not famous in CA or Auto market is not that big in Canada. I could figure out that by searching other brand data maybe later.


Conclusion, 
Acura popular model(MDX,RDX) is similar in both countries but the sales amount has a big difference. US sales is approximately ten times more than CA sales amount.
I could think that the reason is the market size between two countries as well as the number of rich people who can afford money on a car.
another difference is that the bargain sales period. In US, the sales amount is more distributed over a year and high peak end of year. In CA, they more focused on beginning and end of each year. but 
mostly high peak point is placed beginning of each year.
